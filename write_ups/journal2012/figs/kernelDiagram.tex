		\caption{Generative model underlying the preference learning framework. \emph{Left:} the original approach \citep{chu2005} considers the latent preference function $f$ as latent parameter, and the rest of the graphical model as a complex, structured likelihood. \emph{Right:} Our approach re-parametrises the problem in terms of $g$, and thus works with a simpler likelihood but with a more structured prior. The prior takes the form of a Gaussian Process with the preference judgement covariance function. \label{fig:graphical_model}}
