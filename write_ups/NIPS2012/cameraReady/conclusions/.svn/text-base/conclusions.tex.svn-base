\section{Conclusions and Discussion\label{sec:conclusions}}

We have shown that learning user preferences can be recasted as a particular case of binary classification with GPs.
The connection between these two problems is based on a novel covariance function called the preference kernel.
Using this new view, we have proposed a novel multi-task model that
discovers structure in users' preference functions and exploits this to improve predictive performance.
We do not assume access to user features, however, should they be available, an interesting extension would be to
incorporate these features in a GP prior for the user weight vectors in the muti-task model.
This would induce dependences between users with similar features.
We have also presented BALD, a novel active learning strategy for binary classification
models with GPs. The proposed muti-task model with BALD performs favourably in simulated and real-world data
against single-task methods and exhisting approaches for multi-task preference learning.
