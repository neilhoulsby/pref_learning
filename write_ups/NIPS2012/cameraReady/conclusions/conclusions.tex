\section{Conclusions\label{sec:conclusions}}

We have proposed a multi-user model that combines collaborative filtering methods
with GP binary preference modeling.
We have shown that the task of learning user preferences can be recast as a particular case of binary classification with GPs
when a covariance function called the preference kernel is used.
We have also presented BALD,
a novel active learning strategy for binary classification models with GPs. The proposed multi-user model with BALD performs favorably on simulated and real-world data against single-user methods
and existing approaches for multi-user preference learning, whilst having significantly lower computational times than competing multi-user methods.
